Patient: Hi, I'm a 38-year-old Liberian female and I'm currently 12 weeks pregnant. I came to the emergency department because I've been experiencing low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks. Doctor: I see. Let's check your vital signs and do a physical exam. *After checking* Your vital signs are stable and your physical exam shows a gravida abdomen, but is otherwise unremarkable. We'll need to do some laboratory examinations to further investigate your symptoms. Patient: Okay, what kind of tests will you do? Doctor: We'll start with a blood test to measure your beta hCG levels and perform a pelvic ultrasound. *After tests* Your beta hCG level is 118471 and the ultrasound has confirmed a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. We'll admit you to the hospital for close monitoring. Patient: Alright, thank you. Doctor: During your hospital stay, you developed a massive pleural effusion, low-grade fever, progressive worsening abdominal pain, and a spontaneous abortion. We performed a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your chest, which revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion. We also did a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis, which showed bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, thickening and enhancement of the peritoneum, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue, which is suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: We consulted with surgical and oncology specialists for the possibility of exploratory laparotomy and discussed treatment options for presumed ovarian neoplasm. We also did more blood work, which revealed an elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. However, your adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are within normal limits. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: We performed a diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy, which revealed significant pelvis ascites and diffuse miliary lesions throughout the peritoneum. You then underwent dilatation and curettage. The histopathologic examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with no evidence of neoplasm. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Special stains on the tissue sections and ascitic fluid stain revealed rare acid-fast bacilli, which suggests mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis. Upon further questioning, you indicated that you had a positive PPD skin test a year ago but didn't receive any follow-up treatment. We have started you on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy. Patient: Will that help me recover? Doctor: Yes, with the appropriate treatment, you should have a complete recovery. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team and complete the full course of the therapy. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow your advice. [/INST] S: The patient is a 38-year-old Liberian female, 12 weeks pregnant, presenting with low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks. She has a history of a positive PPD skin test one year ago without follow-up treatment. O: Vital signs are stable. Physical examination shows a gravid abdomen but is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory tests reveal a beta hCG level of 118471, confirming a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. Non-contrast-enhanced CT of the chest shows a large right-sided pleural effusion. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis indicates bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, peritoneal thickening and enhancement, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue. Blood tests show elevated CA 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. Adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are normal. Diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy reveals significant pelvic ascites and diffuse miliary lesions on the peritoneum, with histopathology showing chronic granulomatous inflammation without neoplasm. Special stains reveal rare acid-fast bacilli. A: The primary diagnosis is mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis, likely secondary to untreated latent tuberculosis, as indicated by the patient's history and diagnostic findings. Differential diagnosis initially included ovarian neoplasm, but this was ruled out by biopsy and histopathological examination. P: The patient has been started on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy regimen. She will be closely monitored in the hospital, with regular follow-ups to assess the response to treatment and manage any potential side effects of the medication. Education on the importance of adherence to the full course of therapy has been provided to ensure a complete recovery. Referrals to infectious disease specialists and continued consultations with obstetrics and gynecology are planned. </s>\",\n          \"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented with body weight loss. Can you tell me about any medical history you have? Patient: Yes, I have hypertension and diabetes, but both are well-controlled by medication. Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. We've done some laboratory tests, and the data shows that your hemoglobin is decreased at 9.1 g/dl. However, your tumor markers are within normal limits. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We performed a colonoscopy which revealed a circumferential tumor in your sigmoid colon. A histological examination of the biopsy showed that it's a RAS-mutant adenocarcinoma. The RAF mutational status was not investigated. Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed irregular colonic wall thickening with massive involvement of your urinary bladder. There were enlarged regional lymph nodes suggestive of metastases but no distant metastasis. Your pretreatment diagnosis is LACC stage IIIC (T4bN2M0). Patient: So, what's the treatment plan for me? Doctor: We started with a loop transverse colostomy, similar to some other cases. We then planned 6 courses of chemotherapy with CAPOX plus bevacizumab. Patient: How did that go? Doctor: You eventually received 5 courses of CAPOX plus bevacizumab and the remaining 1 course without oxaliplatin due to grade 2 neurotoxicity. A follow-up CT after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed significant tumor shrinkage. Patient: That's good news. Doctor: Yes, it is. Thereafter, we performed a sigmoid colectomy and partial resection of your bladder. The postoperative course was uneventful, and you did not suffer from neurogenic voiding dysfunction or urinary incontinence. Patient: I'm relieved to hear that. Doctor: Pathological examination revealed that tumor cells or degeneration was present in less than one third of the entire lesion, which was consistent with grade 1a effect according to the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma. Patient: So, what's the final diagnosis? Doctor: The final diagnosis is ypT4b, ypN0, M0, ypStage IIC. You subsequently received 8 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine alone. Patient: And how am I doing now? Doctor: There has been no recurrence at 16 months after the initial diagnosis, which is a very positive outcome. Patient: That's great to hear. Thank you for all your help, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your progress and provide any necessary support. [/INST] S: The patient presented with body weight loss and has a history of well-controlled hypertension and diabetes. He reported undergoing various treatments and procedures for a diagnosed sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. O: Laboratory tests showed decreased hemoglobin at 9.1 g/dl (normal range: 13.8-17.2 g/dl for men, 12.1-15.1 g/dl for women). Tumor markers were within normal limits. Colonoscopy revealed a circumferential tumor in the sigmoid colon, confirmed as RAS-mutant adenocarcinoma by biopsy. CT scans indicated irregular colonic wall thickening, involvement of the urinary bladder, and enlarged regional lymph nodes suggestive of metastases, but no distant metastasis. The patient was diagnosed as LACC stage IIIC (T4bN2M0). Post-treatment follow-up showed significant tumor shrinkage and no recurrence at 16 months post-diagnosis. A: The primary diagnosis is locally advanced colorectal cancer (LACC) stage IIIC (T4bN2M0), with a post-treatment stage of ypT4b, ypN0, M0, ypStage IIC. Differential diagnoses were considered based on tumor markers and imaging but were ruled out by biopsy and further pathological examination. P: The patient underwent a loop transverse colostomy and received 6 courses of CAPOX plus bevacizumab, with modifications due to neurotoxicity. This was followed by sigmoid colectomy and partial bladder resection. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. He completed 8 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine. Ongoing monitoring and supportive care will continue to manage and prevent potential recurrence. </s>\",\n          \"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Yes, I have hypertension, diverticulosis, a bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, and I use alcohol daily. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: I've had hiccups for a week now, along with a few episodes of nonbloody and nonbilious emesis. I don't have chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea. Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications? Patient: No, I'm not taking any medications. Doctor: Have you had any prior history of palpitations, syncope, or seizures? Patient: No, I don't have any prior history of those. Doctor: Is there any significant family medical history that I should be aware of? Patient: There's no known significant family medical history. Doctor: Alright. Your triage vital signs show a temperature of 36.2\\u00b0C, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 114, respiratory rate of 18, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The physical examination shows dry mucus membranes, regular heart rate without murmur, soft abdomen, and active hiccups. We'll give you a 1-liter bolus of intravenous normal saline and 25 mg of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) by mouth to help with the hiccups. Patient: Okay, thank you. [15-20 minutes later] Doctor: I'm afraid we've encountered a serious issue. After receiving the chlorpromazine, you went into cardiac arrest. We initiated advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) interventions immediately. Your initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation, requiring four defibrillations at 200 joules each. We also observed Torsades de pointes and administered 2 grams of intravenous magnesium. Patient: Oh my, that's concerning. Doctor: Yes, it is. Your post-arrest ECGs show normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 98-99, but your QTc is between 495-521 ms, which is longer than the normal QTc of <440 ms in men. An arterial blood gas test showed metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.22 (normal range is 7.38\\u20137.42), a lactate level of 14 mmol/L (normal range is 0.60\\u20132.40), and an ionized calcium level of 1.12 mmol/L (normal range is 1.10\\u20131.33). We'll need to perform a comprehensive metabolic panel to investigate further. Patient: I understand, please do what's necessary. Doctor: We'll keep you closely monitored and inform you of any updates. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a known case of hypertension, diverticulosis, and bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, presents with persistent hiccups for one week and episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. He denies chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea. He reports daily alcohol use and is not currently on any medications. No significant family medical history or history of palpitations, syncope, or seizures is reported. O: Initial vital signs include a temperature of 36.2\\u00b0C, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 114 bpm, respiratory rate 18 bpm, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Physical examination reveals dry mucus membranes, regular heart rate without murmur, soft abdomen, and active hiccups. After administration of 25 mg chlorpromazine for hiccups, the patient experienced cardiac arrest with initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, treated with four defibrillations and 2 grams of IV magnesium for observed Torsades de pointes. Post-arrest ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with a QTc of 495-521 ms. Arterial blood gas indicates metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.22, lactate 14 mmol/L, and ionized calcium 1.12 mmol/L. A: The patient's presentation is complicated by a cardiac arrest following chlorpromazine administration, likely exacerbated by underlying electrolyte imbalances and prolonged QTc. Differential diagnoses include acute coronary syndrome, electrolyte disturbances, and complications from chronic alcohol use. P: The patient will be closely monitored in the ICU with continuous cardiac monitoring and electrolyte repletion. A comprehensive metabolic panel will be performed to further assess his condition. Avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs and careful consideration of his alcohol use in management planning are recommended. Further cardiology evaluation may be necessary depending on ongoing findings. Education regarding the risks associated with alcohol use and its potential to exacerbate existing health issues will be provided. </s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Patient: Hi, I'm a 38-year-old Liberian female and I'm currently 12 weeks pregnant. I came to the emergency department because I've been experiencing low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks. Doctor: I see. Let's check your vital signs and do a physical exam. *After checking* Your vital signs are stable and your physical exam shows a gravida abdomen, but is otherwise unremarkable. We'll need to do some laboratory examinations to further investigate your symptoms. Patient: Okay, what kind of tests will you do? Doctor: We'll start with a blood test to measure your beta hCG levels and perform a pelvic ultrasound. *After tests* Your beta hCG level is 118471 and the ultrasound has confirmed a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. We'll admit you to the hospital for close monitoring. Patient: Alright, thank you. Doctor: During your hospital stay, you developed a massive pleural effusion, low-grade fever, progressive worsening abdominal pain, and a spontaneous abortion. We performed a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your chest, which revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion. We also did a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis, which showed bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, thickening and enhancement of the peritoneum, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue, which is suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: We consulted with surgical and oncology specialists for the possibility of exploratory laparotomy and discussed treatment options for presumed ovarian neoplasm. We also did more blood work, which revealed an elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. However, your adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are within normal limits. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: We performed a diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy, which revealed significant pelvis ascites and diffuse miliary lesions throughout the peritoneum. You then underwent dilatation and curettage. The histopathologic examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with no evidence of neoplasm. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Special stains on the tissue sections and ascitic fluid stain revealed rare acid-fast bacilli, which suggests mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis. Upon further questioning, you indicated that you had a positive PPD skin test a year ago but didn't receive any follow-up treatment. We have started you on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy. Patient: Will that help me recover? Doctor: Yes, with the appropriate treatment, you should have a complete recovery. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team and complete the full course of the therapy. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow your advice. [/INST] S: The patient is a 38-year-old Liberian female, 12 weeks pregnant, presenting with low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks. She has a history of a positive PPD skin test one year ago without follow-up treatment. O: Vital signs are stable. Physical examination shows a gravid abdomen but is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory tests reveal a beta hCG level of 118471, confirming a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. Non-contrast-enhanced CT of the chest shows a large right-sided pleural effusion. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis indicates bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, peritoneal thickening and enhancement, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue. Blood tests show elevated CA 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. Adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are normal. Diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy reveals significant pelvic ascites and diffuse miliary lesions on the peritoneum, with histopathology showing chronic granulomatous inflammation without neoplasm. Special stains reveal rare acid-fast bacilli. A: The primary diagnosis is mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis, likely secondary to untreated latent tuberculosis, as indicated by the patient's history and diagnostic findings. Differential diagnosis initially included ovarian neoplasm, but this was ruled out by biopsy and histopathological examination. P: The patient has been started on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy regimen. She will be closely monitored in the hospital, with regular follow-ups to assess the response to treatment and manage any potential side effects of the medication. Education on the importance of adherence to the full course of therapy has been provided to ensure a complete recovery. Referrals to infectious disease specialists and continued consultations with obstetrics and gynecology are planned. </s>\",\n          \"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented with body weight loss. Can you tell me about any medical history you have? Patient: Yes, I have hypertension and diabetes, but both are well-controlled by medication. Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. We've done some laboratory tests, and the data shows that your hemoglobin is decreased at 9.1 g/dl. However, your tumor markers are within normal limits. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We performed a colonoscopy which revealed a circumferential tumor in your sigmoid colon. A histological examination of the biopsy showed that it's a RAS-mutant adenocarcinoma. The RAF mutational status was not investigated. Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed irregular colonic wall thickening with massive involvement of your urinary bladder. There were enlarged regional lymph nodes suggestive of metastases but no distant metastasis. Your pretreatment diagnosis is LACC stage IIIC (T4bN2M0). Patient: So, what's the treatment plan for me? Doctor: We started with a loop transverse colostomy, similar to some other cases. We then planned 6 courses of chemotherapy with CAPOX plus bevacizumab. Patient: How did that go? Doctor: You eventually received 5 courses of CAPOX plus bevacizumab and the remaining 1 course without oxaliplatin due to grade 2 neurotoxicity. A follow-up CT after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed significant tumor shrinkage. Patient: That's good news. Doctor: Yes, it is. Thereafter, we performed a sigmoid colectomy and partial resection of your bladder. The postoperative course was uneventful, and you did not suffer from neurogenic voiding dysfunction or urinary incontinence. Patient: I'm relieved to hear that. Doctor: Pathological examination revealed that tumor cells or degeneration was present in less than one third of the entire lesion, which was consistent with grade 1a effect according to the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma. Patient: So, what's the final diagnosis? Doctor: The final diagnosis is ypT4b, ypN0, M0, ypStage IIC. You subsequently received 8 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine alone. Patient: And how am I doing now? Doctor: There has been no recurrence at 16 months after the initial diagnosis, which is a very positive outcome. Patient: That's great to hear. Thank you for all your help, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your progress and provide any necessary support. [/INST] S: The patient presented with body weight loss and has a history of well-controlled hypertension and diabetes. He reported undergoing various treatments and procedures for a diagnosed sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. O: Laboratory tests showed decreased hemoglobin at 9.1 g/dl (normal range: 13.8-17.2 g/dl for men, 12.1-15.1 g/dl for women). Tumor markers were within normal limits. Colonoscopy revealed a circumferential tumor in the sigmoid colon, confirmed as RAS-mutant adenocarcinoma by biopsy. CT scans indicated irregular colonic wall thickening, involvement of the urinary bladder, and enlarged regional lymph nodes suggestive of metastases, but no distant metastasis. The patient was diagnosed as LACC stage IIIC (T4bN2M0). Post-treatment follow-up showed significant tumor shrinkage and no recurrence at 16 months post-diagnosis. A: The primary diagnosis is locally advanced colorectal cancer (LACC) stage IIIC (T4bN2M0), with a post-treatment stage of ypT4b, ypN0, M0, ypStage IIC. Differential diagnoses were considered based on tumor markers and imaging but were ruled out by biopsy and further pathological examination. P: The patient underwent a loop transverse colostomy and received 6 courses of CAPOX plus bevacizumab, with modifications due to neurotoxicity. This was followed by sigmoid colectomy and partial bladder resection. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. He completed 8 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine. Ongoing monitoring and supportive care will continue to manage and prevent potential recurrence. </s>\",\n          \"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Yes, I have hypertension, diverticulosis, a bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, and I use alcohol daily. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: I've had hiccups for a week now, along with a few episodes of nonbloody and nonbilious emesis. I don't have chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea. Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications? Patient: No, I'm not taking any medications. Doctor: Have you had any prior history of palpitations, syncope, or seizures? Patient: No, I don't have any prior history of those. Doctor: Is there any significant family medical history that I should be aware of? Patient: There's no known significant family medical history. Doctor: Alright. Your triage vital signs show a temperature of 36.2\\u00b0C, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 114, respiratory rate of 18, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The physical examination shows dry mucus membranes, regular heart rate without murmur, soft abdomen, and active hiccups. We'll give you a 1-liter bolus of intravenous normal saline and 25 mg of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) by mouth to help with the hiccups. Patient: Okay, thank you. [15-20 minutes later] Doctor: I'm afraid we've encountered a serious issue. After receiving the chlorpromazine, you went into cardiac arrest. We initiated advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) interventions immediately. Your initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation, requiring four defibrillations at 200 joules each. We also observed Torsades de pointes and administered 2 grams of intravenous magnesium. Patient: Oh my, that's concerning. Doctor: Yes, it is. Your post-arrest ECGs show normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 98-99, but your QTc is between 495-521 ms, which is longer than the normal QTc of <440 ms in men. An arterial blood gas test showed metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.22 (normal range is 7.38\\u20137.42), a lactate level of 14 mmol/L (normal range is 0.60\\u20132.40), and an ionized calcium level of 1.12 mmol/L (normal range is 1.10\\u20131.33). We'll need to perform a comprehensive metabolic panel to investigate further. Patient: I understand, please do what's necessary. Doctor: We'll keep you closely monitored and inform you of any updates. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a known case of hypertension, diverticulosis, and bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, presents with persistent hiccups for one week and episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. He denies chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea. He reports daily alcohol use and is not currently on any medications. No significant family medical history or history of palpitations, syncope, or seizures is reported. O: Initial vital signs include a temperature of 36.2\\u00b0C, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 114 bpm, respiratory rate 18 bpm, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Physical examination reveals dry mucus membranes, regular heart rate without murmur, soft abdomen, and active hiccups. After administration of 25 mg chlorpromazine for hiccups, the patient experienced cardiac arrest with initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, treated with four defibrillations and 2 grams of IV magnesium for observed Torsades de pointes. Post-arrest ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with a QTc of 495-521 ms. Arterial blood gas indicates metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.22, lactate 14 mmol/L, and ionized calcium 1.12 mmol/L. A: The patient's presentation is complicated by a cardiac arrest following chlorpromazine administration, likely exacerbated by underlying electrolyte imbalances and prolonged QTc. Differential diagnoses include acute coronary syndrome, electrolyte disturbances, and complications from chronic alcohol use. P: The patient will be closely monitored in the ICU with continuous cardiac monitoring and electrolyte repletion. A comprehensive metabolic panel will be performed to further assess his condition. Avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs and careful consideration of his alcohol use in management planning are recommended. Further cardiology evaluation may be necessary depending on ongoing findings. Education regarding the risks associated with alcohol use and its potential to exacerbate existing health issues will be provided. </s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Patient: Hi, I'm a 38-year-old Liberian female and I'm currently 12 weeks pregnant. I came to the emergency department because I've been experiencing low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks. Doctor: I see. Let's check your vital signs and do a physical exam. *After checking* Your vital signs are stable and your physical exam shows a gravida abdomen, but is otherwise unremarkable. We'll need to do some laboratory examinations to further investigate your symptoms. Patient: Okay, what kind of tests will you do? Doctor: We'll start with a blood test to measure your beta hCG levels and perform a pelvic ultrasound. *After tests* Your beta hCG level is 118471 and the ultrasound has confirmed a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. We'll admit you to the hospital for close monitoring. Patient: Alright, thank you. Doctor: During your hospital stay, you developed a massive pleural effusion, low-grade fever, progressive worsening abdominal pain, and a spontaneous abortion. We performed a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your chest, which revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion. We also did a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis, which showed bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, thickening and enhancement of the peritoneum, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue, which is suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: We consulted with surgical and oncology specialists for the possibility of exploratory laparotomy and discussed treatment options for presumed ovarian neoplasm. We also did more blood work, which revealed an elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. However, your adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are within normal limits. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: We performed a diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy, which revealed significant pelvis ascites and diffuse miliary lesions throughout the peritoneum. You then underwent dilatation and curettage. The histopathologic examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with no evidence of neoplasm. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Special stains on the tissue sections and ascitic fluid stain revealed rare acid-fast bacilli, which suggests mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis. Upon further questioning, you indicated that you had a positive PPD skin test a year ago but didn't receive any follow-up treatment. We have started you on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy. Patient: Will that help me recover? Doctor: Yes, with the appropriate treatment, you should have a complete recovery. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team and complete the full course of the therapy. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow your advice. [/INST] S: The patient is a 38-year-old Liberian female, 12 weeks pregnant, presenting with low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks. She has a history of a positive PPD skin test one year ago without follow-up treatment. O: Vital signs are stable. Physical examination shows a gravid abdomen but is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory tests reveal a beta hCG level of 118471, confirming a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. Non-contrast-enhanced CT of the chest shows a large right-sided pleural effusion. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis indicates bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, peritoneal thickening and enhancement, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue. Blood tests show elevated CA 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. Adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are normal. Diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy reveals significant pelvic ascites and diffuse miliary lesions on the peritoneum, with histopathology showing chronic granulomatous inflammation without neoplasm. Special stains reveal rare acid-fast bacilli. A: The primary diagnosis is mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis, likely secondary to untreated latent tuberculosis, as indicated by the patient's history and diagnostic findings. Differential diagnosis initially included ovarian neoplasm, but this was ruled out by biopsy and histopathological examination. P: The patient has been started on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy regimen. She will be closely monitored in the hospital, with regular follow-ups to assess the response to treatment and manage any potential side effects of the medication. Education on the importance of adherence to the full course of therapy has been provided to ensure a complete recovery. Referrals to infectious disease specialists and continued consultations with obstetrics and gynecology are planned. </s>\",\n          \"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I see you've presented with body weight loss. Can you tell me about any medical history you have? Patient: Yes, I have hypertension and diabetes, but both are well-controlled by medication. Doctor: Okay, thank you for letting me know. We've done some laboratory tests, and the data shows that your hemoglobin is decreased at 9.1 g/dl. However, your tumor markers are within normal limits. Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We performed a colonoscopy which revealed a circumferential tumor in your sigmoid colon. A histological examination of the biopsy showed that it's a RAS-mutant adenocarcinoma. The RAF mutational status was not investigated. Patient: Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Doctor: A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed irregular colonic wall thickening with massive involvement of your urinary bladder. There were enlarged regional lymph nodes suggestive of metastases but no distant metastasis. Your pretreatment diagnosis is LACC stage IIIC (T4bN2M0). Patient: So, what's the treatment plan for me? Doctor: We started with a loop transverse colostomy, similar to some other cases. We then planned 6 courses of chemotherapy with CAPOX plus bevacizumab. Patient: How did that go? Doctor: You eventually received 5 courses of CAPOX plus bevacizumab and the remaining 1 course without oxaliplatin due to grade 2 neurotoxicity. A follow-up CT after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed significant tumor shrinkage. Patient: That's good news. Doctor: Yes, it is. Thereafter, we performed a sigmoid colectomy and partial resection of your bladder. The postoperative course was uneventful, and you did not suffer from neurogenic voiding dysfunction or urinary incontinence. Patient: I'm relieved to hear that. Doctor: Pathological examination revealed that tumor cells or degeneration was present in less than one third of the entire lesion, which was consistent with grade 1a effect according to the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma. Patient: So, what's the final diagnosis? Doctor: The final diagnosis is ypT4b, ypN0, M0, ypStage IIC. You subsequently received 8 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine alone. Patient: And how am I doing now? Doctor: There has been no recurrence at 16 months after the initial diagnosis, which is a very positive outcome. Patient: That's great to hear. Thank you for all your help, Doctor. Doctor: You're welcome. We will continue to monitor your progress and provide any necessary support. [/INST] S: The patient presented with body weight loss and has a history of well-controlled hypertension and diabetes. He reported undergoing various treatments and procedures for a diagnosed sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma. O: Laboratory tests showed decreased hemoglobin at 9.1 g/dl (normal range: 13.8-17.2 g/dl for men, 12.1-15.1 g/dl for women). Tumor markers were within normal limits. Colonoscopy revealed a circumferential tumor in the sigmoid colon, confirmed as RAS-mutant adenocarcinoma by biopsy. CT scans indicated irregular colonic wall thickening, involvement of the urinary bladder, and enlarged regional lymph nodes suggestive of metastases, but no distant metastasis. The patient was diagnosed as LACC stage IIIC (T4bN2M0). Post-treatment follow-up showed significant tumor shrinkage and no recurrence at 16 months post-diagnosis. A: The primary diagnosis is locally advanced colorectal cancer (LACC) stage IIIC (T4bN2M0), with a post-treatment stage of ypT4b, ypN0, M0, ypStage IIC. Differential diagnoses were considered based on tumor markers and imaging but were ruled out by biopsy and further pathological examination. P: The patient underwent a loop transverse colostomy and received 6 courses of CAPOX plus bevacizumab, with modifications due to neurotoxicity. This was followed by sigmoid colectomy and partial bladder resection. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. He completed 8 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine. Ongoing monitoring and supportive care will continue to manage and prevent potential recurrence. </s>\",\n          \"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history? Patient: Yes, I have hypertension, diverticulosis, a bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, and I use alcohol daily. Doctor: Thank you for sharing that. What brings you to the emergency department today? Patient: I've had hiccups for a week now, along with a few episodes of nonbloody and nonbilious emesis. I don't have chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea. Doctor: Are you currently taking any medications? Patient: No, I'm not taking any medications. Doctor: Have you had any prior history of palpitations, syncope, or seizures? Patient: No, I don't have any prior history of those. Doctor: Is there any significant family medical history that I should be aware of? Patient: There's no known significant family medical history. Doctor: Alright. Your triage vital signs show a temperature of 36.2\\u00b0C, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 114, respiratory rate of 18, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. The physical examination shows dry mucus membranes, regular heart rate without murmur, soft abdomen, and active hiccups. We'll give you a 1-liter bolus of intravenous normal saline and 25 mg of chlorpromazine (Thorazine) by mouth to help with the hiccups. Patient: Okay, thank you. [15-20 minutes later] Doctor: I'm afraid we've encountered a serious issue. After receiving the chlorpromazine, you went into cardiac arrest. We initiated advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) interventions immediately. Your initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation, requiring four defibrillations at 200 joules each. We also observed Torsades de pointes and administered 2 grams of intravenous magnesium. Patient: Oh my, that's concerning. Doctor: Yes, it is. Your post-arrest ECGs show normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 98-99, but your QTc is between 495-521 ms, which is longer than the normal QTc of <440 ms in men. An arterial blood gas test showed metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.22 (normal range is 7.38\\u20137.42), a lactate level of 14 mmol/L (normal range is 0.60\\u20132.40), and an ionized calcium level of 1.12 mmol/L (normal range is 1.10\\u20131.33). We'll need to perform a comprehensive metabolic panel to investigate further. Patient: I understand, please do what's necessary. Doctor: We'll keep you closely monitored and inform you of any updates. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I really appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, a known case of hypertension, diverticulosis, and bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, presents with persistent hiccups for one week and episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. He denies chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea. He reports daily alcohol use and is not currently on any medications. No significant family medical history or history of palpitations, syncope, or seizures is reported. O: Initial vital signs include a temperature of 36.2\\u00b0C, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 114 bpm, respiratory rate 18 bpm, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Physical examination reveals dry mucus membranes, regular heart rate without murmur, soft abdomen, and active hiccups. After administration of 25 mg chlorpromazine for hiccups, the patient experienced cardiac arrest with initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, treated with four defibrillations and 2 grams of IV magnesium for observed Torsades de pointes. Post-arrest ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with a QTc of 495-521 ms. Arterial blood gas indicates metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.22, lactate 14 mmol/L, and ionized calcium 1.12 mmol/L. A: The patient's presentation is complicated by a cardiac arrest following chlorpromazine administration, likely exacerbated by underlying electrolyte imbalances and prolonged QTc. Differential diagnoses include acute coronary syndrome, electrolyte disturbances, and complications from chronic alcohol use. P: The patient will be closely monitored in the ICU with continuous cardiac monitoring and electrolyte repletion. A comprehensive metabolic panel will be performed to further assess his condition. Avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs and careful consideration of his alcohol use in management planning are recommended. Further cardiology evaluation may be necessary depending on ongoing findings. Education regarding the risks associated with alcohol use and its potential to exacerbate existing health issues will be provided. </s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"distance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.014326406328100243,\n        \"min\": 0.5676316538145173,\n        \"max\": 0.6646207154296946,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 250,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.6273307793551887,\n          0.6479116932216044,\n          0.6143901893142175\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Patient: Hi, I'm a 38-year-old Liberian female and I'm currently 12 weeks pregnant. I came to the emergency department because I've been experiencing low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks. Doctor: I see. Let's check your vital signs and do a physical exam. *After checking* Your vital signs are stable and your physical exam shows a gravida abdomen, but is otherwise unremarkable. We'll need to do some laboratory examinations to further investigate your symptoms. Patient: Okay, what kind of tests will you do? Doctor: We'll start with a blood test to measure your beta hCG levels and perform a pelvic ultrasound. *After tests* Your beta hCG level is 118471 and the ultrasound has confirmed a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. We'll admit you to the hospital for close monitoring. Patient: Alright, thank you. Doctor: During your hospital stay, you developed a massive pleural effusion, low-grade fever, progressive worsening abdominal pain, and a spontaneous abortion. We performed a non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your chest, which revealed a large right-sided pleural effusion. We also did a contrast-enhanced computed tomography of your abdomen and pelvis, which showed bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, thickening and enhancement of the peritoneum, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue, which is suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis. Patient: Oh no, what does that mean? Doctor: We consulted with surgical and oncology specialists for the possibility of exploratory laparotomy and discussed treatment options for presumed ovarian neoplasm. We also did more blood work, which revealed an elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. However, your adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are within normal limits. Patient: So, what's the next step? Doctor: We performed a diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy, which revealed significant pelvis ascites and diffuse miliary lesions throughout the peritoneum. You then underwent dilatation and curettage. The histopathologic examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with no evidence of neoplasm. Patient: What does that mean for me? Doctor: Special stains on the tissue sections and ascitic fluid stain revealed rare acid-fast bacilli, which suggests mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis. Upon further questioning, you indicated that you had a positive PPD skin test a year ago but didn't receive any follow-up treatment. We have started you on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy. Patient: Will that help me recover? Doctor: Yes, with the appropriate treatment, you should have a complete recovery. It's important to follow up with your healthcare team and complete the full course of the therapy. Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I'll make sure to follow your advice. [/INST] S: The patient is a 38-year-old Liberian female, 12 weeks pregnant, presenting with low-grade fever, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, worsening abdominal pain, and intermittent spotting for the past 3 weeks. She has a history of a positive PPD skin test one year ago without follow-up treatment. O: Vital signs are stable. Physical examination shows a gravid abdomen but is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory tests reveal a beta hCG level of 118471, confirming a 12-week viable intrauterine pregnancy. Non-contrast-enhanced CT of the chest shows a large right-sided pleural effusion. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis indicates bilateral hilar adenopathy, ascites, peritoneal thickening and enhancement, and mottled nodular-appearing soft tissue. Blood tests show elevated CA 125 and a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. Adenosine deaminase, CA 19, alpha-fetoprotein, and inhibin B levels are normal. Diagnostic laparoscopy with biopsy reveals significant pelvic ascites and diffuse miliary lesions on the peritoneum, with histopathology showing chronic granulomatous inflammation without neoplasm. Special stains reveal rare acid-fast bacilli. A: The primary diagnosis is mycobacterial granulomatous peritonitis, likely secondary to untreated latent tuberculosis, as indicated by the patient's history and diagnostic findings. Differential diagnosis initially included ovarian neoplasm, but this was ruled out by biopsy and histopathological examination. P: The patient has been started on a four-drug anti-tuberculous therapy regimen. She will be closely monitored in the hospital, with regular follow-ups to assess the response to treatment and manage any potential side effects of the medication. Education on the importance of adherence to the full course of therapy has been provided to ensure a complete recovery. Referrals to infectious disease specialists and continued consultations with obstetrics and gynecology are planned. </s>\",\n          \"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello! I see from your history that you've been dealing with Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL for two years now. Can you tell me about the symptoms that led you to the emergency department back in June 2015? Patient: Yeah, I had been feeling really tired and lethargic for a couple of weeks. I also had backache, leg, and rib pain that was so bad that even opioids didn't help. Doctor: I see. Your blood counts at that time showed leukocytosis with a white cell count of 67 \\u00d7 10^9 cells/l and 34% lymphoblasts measured by flow cytometry. Your hemoglobin was 12.3 g/dl and your platelet count was at 49 \\u00d7 10^9/l. A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy confirmed that you had a precursor B-cell ALL, Ph+ (t 9; 22). You were then enrolled in the UKALL14, version 6 Protocol, which is a five-drug induction regimen designed for adults with de novo ALL between 25 and 65 years.  Patient: Yeah, I remember that. They gave me a bunch of medications. Doctor: Yes, during Induction Phase I, you received PEG-ASP (1000 IU/m2) on days 4 and 18, daunorubicin 30 mg/m2 and vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 on days 1\\u20134, 8\\u201311, 15\\u201318, and intrathecal methotrexate (ITMTX) 12.5 mg on day 14. You were also given continuous imatinib 400 mg, which was later escalated to 600 mg daily throughout your induction treatment. Patient: That's right. And then I had another round of treatment. Doctor: Correct. During Phase II induction, you were given cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, Ara-C 75 mg/m2 on days 2\\u20135, 9\\u201312, 16\\u201319, and 23\\u201326, mercaptopurine 60 mg/m2 throughout, and intrathecal methotrexate on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patient: So, what happened after that? Doctor: After Phase II induction, you achieved a complete molecular remission with negative BCR-ABL1 p190 transcripts, as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, you did experience some complications, including constipation, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia. Patient: Yeah, that was a tough time. What came next? Doctor: To consolidate your remission, you underwent myeloablative conditioning, which included cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI). This was followed by a stem cell transplant to help rebuild your immune system and fight off any remaining cancer cells. Patient: I remember that. It was quite an intense treatment. Doctor: Yes, it can be. But the good news is that you achieved a complete molecular remission, which is a great outcome. It's important to continue with regular follow-ups and monitoring to ensure that your condition remains stable and any potential complications are addressed promptly. [/INST] S: The patient, diagnosed with Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL, reported extreme fatigue, backache, and pain in the legs and ribs, which were unresponsive to opioids, leading to their initial presentation in June 2015. O: Initial blood counts showed leukocytosis with a white cell count of 67 \\u00d7 10^9 cells/l, 34% lymphoblasts, hemoglobin at 12.3 g/dl, and platelets at 49 \\u00d7 10^9/l. Diagnosis was confirmed via bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. During treatment, the patient received a multi-drug regimen including PEG-ASP, daunorubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, intrathecal methotrexate, and imatinib, followed by cyclophosphamide, Ara-C, mercaptopurine, and additional intrathecal methotrexate. Complications included constipation, febrile neutropenia, and pneumonia. Post-treatment, the patient achieved complete molecular remission confirmed by negative BCR-ABL1 p190 transcripts via RT-PCR. A: Primary diagnosis is Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL. The patient achieved complete molecular remission following intensive chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. Differential diagnoses during initial presentation could have included other forms of leukemia or hematologic disorders. Prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the current remission status, but vigilant monitoring for relapse or secondary complications is necessary. P: The patient will continue with regular follow-up appointments to monitor for any signs of relapse or complications. Ongoing supportive care for post-transplant recovery and management of any long-term side effects from chemotherapy is essential. Education on signs of potential relapse and when to seek immediate care will be provided. Referrals to a nutritionist for dietary management and a physical therapist for recovery from treatment-related deconditioning may be beneficial. </s>\",\n          \"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I heard you have a 6-month history of swelling in the left floor of your mouth, and you were referred to our institution. How can I help you today? Patient: Yes, that's right. I've been experiencing some difficulty in swallowing, but I haven't had any pain or tongue paralysis. Doctor: I see. Let's perform an intraoral examination to better understand the issue. Hmm, I can see a well-defined 3.5 \\u00d7 3 \\u00d7 2 cm-sized solid, spherical submucosal nodule adjacent to the sublingual gland. It's covered with light bluish smooth mucus. Do you feel any pain when I apply pressure to the tumor? Patient: Yes, I feel slight pain when you press on it. Doctor: Alright. Your tongue's mobility and sensory functions seem to be normal, and I don't detect any lymphadenopathy in the submandibular region on palpation. We'll need to conduct some laboratory tests and an enhanced computed tomography scan to get a clearer picture of the issue. Patient: Okay, I understand. [After the tests] Doctor: Your lab results are all normal, and the enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a 2.8 \\u00d7 1.8 \\u00d7 2.1 cm-sized well-defined, solid, heterogeneous nodule that doesn't appear to involve the mandible. We also found a nodular lesion occupying the left floor of the mouth with abundant blood flow. No enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the submental or submandibular regions. Patient: So, what does that mean, doctor? Doctor: Based on these findings, our initial clinical impression is that this could be a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. We will need to schedule you for surgery via an intraoral approach to remove the tumor and further examine it. Patient: Alright, so what will the surgery involve? Doctor: During the surgery, we'll make an elliptical incision around the periphery of the sublingual gland, and prepare a full-thickness tissue flap along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. After freeing the sublingual gland from its surrounding tissue, we'll find the well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension beneath the body of the sublingual gland. We'll carefully free the submandibular gland duct and lingual nerve from the tumor surface, and completely excise the tumor along with the sublingual gland. Patient: I see. What happens after the surgery? Doctor: After the surgery, we'll fix the tissue sample with 10% formalin and submit it for histopathological diagnosis to determine the exact nature of the tumor. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'm ready to proceed with the surgery and follow-up care. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll make sure to take good care of you during and after the surgery. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to us. [/INST] S: The patient reports a 6-month history of swelling in the left floor of the mouth, accompanied by difficulty swallowing. The patient denies experiencing pain or tongue paralysis.

              "\"<s>[INST] Doctor: Hi there, I'm Dr. Smith. I see you've been admitted to the Emergency Department due to agitation and an altered consciousness. Can you tell me when these symptoms started? Patient: Hey, doctor. They started just a few hours ago, and I've been feeling a progressive loss of verbal contact. Doctor: I understand. Your medical history shows that you have arterial hypertension, which is treated with atenolol. When you were admitted, your Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 9/15 with moderate neck stiffness. Your pupils were mid-size, reactive, and symmetric. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct. Doctor: Your vital signs showed a body temperature of 36.6°C, arterial blood pressure of 180/95 mm Hg, heart rate of 120/min, and respiratory rate of 60/min. We performed a brain computed tomography (CT) without iodinated contrast agent perfusion before the lumbar puncture, and it didn't reveal any significant abnormalities. Due to your progressive respiratory distress, intubation was required.  Patient: Oh, I see. Doctor: We also conducted a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 560/μl, with 99% granulocytes, proteins at 1264 mg/dl, glucose at 3 mg/dl, and lactate at 27 mmol/l. Patient: What does that mean, doctor? Doctor: The CSF and blood cultures tested positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is sensitive to penicillin G and ceftriaxone. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 0.016 mcg/ml for penicillin G and ceftriaxone in the CSF, and 0.012 and 0.008 mcg/ml in blood for penicillin G and ceftriaxone, respectively. Patient: So, what's the treatment plan? Doctor: We've started you on a combination of dexamethasone (10 mg q6h for 4 days) and ceftriaxone (2 g q12h for 14 days). After 10 days, we'll repeat the CSF analysis to confirm the drop in WBC count and eradication of the causative microorganism. Patient: Alright, thank you. Doctor: However, I have to inform you that you've been referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to the worsening of your GCS score, which is now 6/15. Even though there's no evidence of acute hydrocephalus, we'll be monitoring your intracranial pressure (ICP). Patient: I understand, doctor. Thank you for letting me know. Doctor: You're welcome. We'll do our best to help you recover. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. [/INST] S: The patient, admitted to the Emergency Department, reports symptoms of agitation and altered consciousness starting a few hours ago, with a progressive loss of verbal contact. The patient has a history of arterial hypertension treated with atenolol. O: Upon admission, the patient's Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 9/15, indicating moderate consciousness impairment, and has since worsened to 6/15. The patient exhibited moderate neck stiffness, mid-sized, reactive, symmetric pupils, a body temperature of 36.6°C, arterial blood pressure of 180/95 mm Hg, heart rate of 120/min, and a respiratory rate of 60/min. Brain CT showed no significant abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a WBC count of 560/μl with 99% granulocytes, proteins at 1264 mg/dl, glucose at 3 mg/dl, and lactate at 27 mmol/l. CSF and blood cultures tested positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, sensitive to penicillin G and ceftriaxone. The patient required intubation due to progressive respiratory distress. A: The primary diagnosis is bacterial meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, complicated by severe sepsis and respiratory distress. Differential diagnoses could include viral encephalitis or other forms of bacterial meningitis, but these are less likely given the CSF findings and culture results. P: The patient has been started on dexamethasone 10 mg every 6 hours for 4 days and ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 hours for 14 days. A repeat CSF analysis is scheduled in 10 days to monitor treatment efficacy. The patient has been referred to the ICU for close monitoring of intracranial pressure and further management of GCS deterioration and respiratory distress. Education on the treatment plan and potential complications has been provided, with an emphasis on the importance of compliance with the prescribed therapy. </s>\\n<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, young lady. How can I help you today? Patient: Hi, doctor. I've been having this problem with my neck swelling up on the left side since I was 6 years old. Doctor: I see. Have you had any treatment for this swelling? Patient: Yes, I had some treatment to control the inflammation. Doctor: Good. Did you have any tests done after the inflammation was controlled? Patient: Yes, I had a barium esophagography done. Doctor: Alright. And what did the results show? Patient: The results showed a PSF on the left side of my neck. Doctor: Okay, and did you have a CT scan as well? Patient: Yes, and it showed an air- and barium-containing fistula. Doctor: I understand. We decided to perform a MLS as the first-line treatment for you. Do you remember the details of the procedure? Patient: Hmm, I remember the doctor saying that the fistula was narrow and the tissue wasn't fragile. Doctor: That's correct. We made the incision as small as possible during the surgery (Fig. , ). The operation was completed uneventfully (Fig. ). On the fifth postoperative day, we performed another barium esophagography. Did you experience any leakage after that? Patient: No, there wasn't any leakage. Doctor: Great. You were able to start free oral intake on the same day, right? Patient: Yes, I was able to eat and drink without any problems. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that. You had an uneventful recovery and were discharged from the hospital 7 days after the surgery. How have you been feeling since then? Patient: I've been feeling much better, and I haven't had any recurrence of the swelling. Doctor: That's excellent news. I'm happy to hear that you're doing well. Remember to come back for regular check-ups to ensure everything remains fine. If you ever experience any issues, don't hesitate to contact us. Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance. [/INST] S: The patient, a young female, reports a history of left-sided neck swelling since age 6. She mentions previous treatments aimed at controlling inflammation and has undergone diagnostic evaluations including barium esophagography and CT scan, which identified a PSF (pharyngeal salivary fistula) containing air and barium. O: The patient underwent a minimally invasive lateral surgery (MLS) to address the fistula, described as narrow with non-fragile tissue. Postoperative evaluations showed no leakage, and she was able to resume oral intake immediately after the procedure. She was discharged 7 days post-surgery without complications. A: The primary diagnosis is a left-sided pharyngeal salivary fistula. The successful surgical intervention and absence of postoperative complications or recurrence of symptoms suggest a positive outcome. P: The patient is advised to continue regular follow-ups to monitor for any potential recurrence or complications. She is encouraged to report any new symptoms immediately. No additional treatment is currently required given the successful postoperative recovery and lack of symptoms. </s>\\n<s>[INST] Doctor: Hello, I understand you have been diagnosed with kappa light chain multiple myeloma and ESRD. We have treated you with five cycles of CyBorD followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide mobilization and autologous HSCT with melphalan 140 mg/m2 therapy. How are you feeling now? Patient: I've been feeling quite weak, and I recently had a fever. Doctor: I see. It appears that you developed a neutropenic fever with Streptococcus sanguinis bacteremia. We have been treating you with vancomycin, cefazolin, and metronidazole for that infection. Have you had any history of liver disease? Patient: No, I've never had any liver problems before. Doctor: Your total serum bilirubin level was 3.4 mg/dl at the time of transplantation, and it peaked on treatment day 24 at 22 mg/dl. We performed imaging and discovered ascites, which is fluid in your abdominal cavity. We also conducted a liver biopsy on treatment day 16, which was consistent with SOS (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome). Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What are the next steps in my treatment? Doctor: We have started treating you with ursodiol, a medication that helps protect the liver. Unfortunately, your condition has worsened, and we were hoping to get defibrotide for you under compassionate use.  Patient: So, when can I start the defibrotide treatment? Doctor: I'm sorry to inform you that we were unable to secure the defibrotide in time. Your loved one passed away on treatment day 25. Our deepest condolences to you and your family. Family Member: Thank you, Doctor. We appreciate all the efforts you and your team made to help him. [/INST] S: The patient, diagnosed with kappa light chain multiple myeloma and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), reported feeling weak and having a recent fever. The patient denied any history of liver disease. O: The patient underwent five cycles of CyBorD followed by high-dose cyclophosphamide mobilization and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with melphalan at a dose of 140 mg/m2. Developed neutropenic fever with Streptococcus sanguinis bacteremia, treated with vancomycin, cefazolin, and metronidazole. Total serum bilirubin was elevated at 3.4 mg/dl at transplantation, peaking at 22 mg/dl on treatment day 24. Imaging revealed ascites, and liver biopsy on treatment day 16 confirmed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS). The patient was started on ursodiol for liver protection. Efforts to obtain defibrotide under compassionate use were unsuccessful. A: The primary diagnosis is kappa light chain multiple myeloma with complications including ESRD, neutropenic fever with bacteremia, and SOS post-HSCT. The prognosis was poor, leading to the patient's demise on treatment day 25. P: Treatment included administration of CyBorD, high-dose cyclophosphamide, and autologous HSCT with melphalan. Management of complications involved antibiotics for bacteremia and ursodiol for SOS. Attempts were made to secure defibrotide for SOS under compassionate use, which were not successful. Palliative care and support were provided until the patient's passing. </s>\""
